# Advent of Code 2025

This year is only 12 days so I'm going to finish this one... even though I'm hitting it starting in January...

## Cpp

I'm using C++23 for everything in C++ land. That doesn't mean I'm necessarily using C++23 paradigms, just that I'm making all the good libs available for use. Evenutally I'll get used to `<print>`...

Everything is built using the build command in the `build.sh` files in each day's repository. Yes I could make a better build script that doesn't get copied from day to day, but I can't be bothered. 

## Rust

This is just so I don't lose everything I've learned in Rust. I'm not great at the language and just trying to develop/not lose all my rust knowledge.

## Other languages

I'll probably revert to Python at some point, and I may even try to do this stuff in Go if I'm feeling motivated enough. We shall see...
